                    <p>
                        Welcome! This is my implementation of the boids algorithm developed by
                        Craig Reynolds. By having each boid independently follow 3 simple rules,
                        complex group behavior emerges that simulates the flocking behavior of
                        birds. The rules are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Separation: steer to avoid collision with nearby boids</li>
                        <li>Alignment: steer towards average heading of nearby boids</li>
                        <li>Cohesion: steer towards center of surrounding boids</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        I also added obstacle avoidance, where the boids will steer away from
                        and avoid the cursor.

                    <p>
                        This project was made using p5.js and basic CSS, HTML, and JS. To challenge
                        myself during development, I implemented a quad tree to handle neighbor
                        detection which you can see with debug mode. Enjoy!

                        <strong>Click</strong> to spawn more boids

                        <strong>D</strong> - toggles debug mode, outlining the nodes of the quadtree and highlighting
                        one boid to show which nodes are included in the neighbor search
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>S</strong> - toggles obstacle avoidance to control whether boids avoid the cursor

                        <strong>R</strong> - resets simulation
