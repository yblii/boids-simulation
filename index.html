                    <p>
                        Welcome! This is my implementation of the boids algorithm developed by 
                        Craig Reynolds. By having each boid independently follow 3 simple rules, 
                        complex group behavior emerges that simulates the flocking behavior of 
                        birds. The rules are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Separation: steer to avoid collision with nearby boids</li>
                        <li>Alignment: steer towards average heading of nearby boids</li>
                        <li>Cohesion: steer towards center of surrounding boids</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        I also added obstacle avoidance, where the boids will steer away from 
                        and avoid the cursor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project was made using p5.js and basic CSS, HTML, and JS. To challenge 
                        myself during development, I implemented a quad tree to handle neighbor 
                        detection (even though there are more practical methods) which you can see 
                        with debug mode.

                        <strong>D</strong> - toggles debug mode, outlining the nodes of the quadtree and highlighting 
                        one boid to show which nodes are included in the neighbor search
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>S</strong> - toggles obstacle avoidance to control whether boids avoid the cursor
